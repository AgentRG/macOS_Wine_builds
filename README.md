# Winehq_macOS_Builds
 
 Currently Winehq is not providing macOS builds until they replace the now deprecated builder,\ so as I temporary measure I'll attach `wine-staging` builds here that includes most\ dependencies meaning XQuartz-2.7.7 or later is not required unless you desire to use X11 over macDriver.
 
 Currently avalible on releases section;
 - `wine-staging-5.9-osx64.tar.gz`
 - `wine-devel-5.9-osx64.tar.gz`

_Please Note;_ these will function like macOS pkg releases but are packaged within a `.tar.gz`.\
I won't be making pkg installer, these packages include `wine` and `wine64`
